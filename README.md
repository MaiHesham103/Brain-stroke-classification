**Brain Stroke Classification**

ðŸ“Š This project is all about using the power of data to help predict the risk of brain strokes. We've analyzed a wealth of medical data and leveraged machine-learning techniques to create a classification model that can identify individuals who may be at risk.

ðŸš€ **Key Features**:

- **Data-driven Insights**: Our project dives deep into medical data, uncovering hidden patterns and trends that could save lives.

- **Machine Learning Magic**: We've used cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to build a powerful classification model.

- **Resampling for Accuracy**: To ensure our model is robust and fair, we've implemented resampling techniques to address the class imbalance and make sure it performs well for all scenarios.

ðŸ“ˆ **Why Resampling Matters**:

Class imbalance can be a significant challenge in medical data analysis. In this project, we've paid special attention to this issue. By resampling the data, we've balanced our dataset, which is crucial for accurate predictions. This ensures that our model doesn't favor one class over another, making it reliable and trustworthy.
