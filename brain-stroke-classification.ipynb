Then we explore the data and visulize it.\n\n* We notice that Most of the data are women,do not have hypertension or heart disease, married, work as private, the residence type is equal between urban and rural, and only about 16% smoke.\n\n* We concluded that the percentage of infection is higher in those who do not have hypertension or heart disease, but this may be due to the fact that most of the observations do not suffer this does not mean that hypertension and heart diseases are not related to stroke.\n\n* We noticed that this data is unbalanced, so we tried to handle it with the resampling techniques (oversampling and undersampling), we used different machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to predict the patients. We compared the accuracy and precision of the models. We found that Logistic Regression gave the best results when we use it with SMOTE oversampling.","metadata":{}}]}
